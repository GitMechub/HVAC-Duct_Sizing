# HVAC-Duct_Sizing
 This Jupyter Notebook simplifies HVAC duct sizing by using the Scipy optimization function. You only need to specify the section where the air terminals are located, their flow rates, the length of each section of the entire system, and any project-specific constraints for effective duct sizing.
